The code in this repository is collection of scientific codes developed
(or adapted from existing codes) under funding from the
NASA Remote Sensing Theory Project.

Procedures in directory src_f90 are based on operational code developed
with support from the NASA  Project.

Procedures in directory MCRT solve the radiative transfer equation for
a space borne radar.

Codes in forwardModel are a general space-borne simulation model. The multiple
scattering model is not that in MCRT directory, but the 1D fast model
of Hogan and Battaglia.
